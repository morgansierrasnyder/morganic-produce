            <p>Hi there,</p>
            <p>I'm an engineer and artist living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I've sampled many different mediums over the years, in an attempt to satisfy my urge to create things of beauty and utility for others. My go-to methods are coding, illustrating, planting, and musicmaking - especially guitar-strumming, horn-blowing and free-styling. I currently teach engineering and design to ninth graders at an independent high school. I'm often reminded that I'm their student, as well.</p>
            <p>The Latest:</p>
            <p>Interested in supporting web design, scientific illustration, mural painting or stationery design projects.</p>
            <p>Seeking support for my children's book(s), dream portraits, and cards for humanity projects.</p>
            <p>Please reach out for commissions, collaborations, or salutations!</p>
            <p>Much love,</p>
            <p>Morgan Sierra Snyder</p>
